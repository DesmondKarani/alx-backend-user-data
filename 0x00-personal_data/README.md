# 0x00. Personal Data Back-end Authentication

## Overview
This project involves creating a backend authentication system with a focus on managing personal data securely. You will learn about Personally Identifiable Information (PII), logging practices, password encryption, and database authentication using environment variables.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Identify examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- Implement a log filter to obfuscate PII fields.
- Encrypt passwords and validate input passwords.
- Authenticate to a database using environment variables.

## Resources
- [What Is PII, non-PII, and Personal Data?](https://example.com/pii)
- [Logging Documentation](https://example.com/logging-docs)
- [bcrypt Package](https://example.com/bcrypt)
- [Logging to Files, Setting Levels, and Formatting](https://example.com/logging-files)

## Requirements
- Your files must be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
- End all files with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
- Adhere to the pycodestyle style guide (version 2.5).
- Ensure all files are executable.
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`.
- Document all modules, classes, and functions using Python docstrings.
- Type annotations are required for all functions.

## Project Tasks
1. **Identify PII**: Understand and list examples of PII.
2. **Log Filter**: Implement a log filter to obfuscate PII fields in logs.
3. **Password Encryption**: Use the `bcrypt` package to encrypt passwords and validate input passwords.
4. **Database Authentication**: Authenticate to a database using environment variables.

## Execution and Review
- The project starts on Jul 3, 2024, at 6:00 AM and ends by Jul 5, 2024, at 6:00 AM.
- A checker will be released on Jul 3, 2024, at 6:00 PM.
- Request manual QA review when the project is complete.
- An auto-review will be conducted at the deadline.
